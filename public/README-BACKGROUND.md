# City Background Image

To use the city map background image from the reference design:

1. Save your city background image as `city-background.jpg` in the `public/` folder
2. The image should be an aerial view of a city at night with illuminated buildings
3. Recommended dimensions: 1920x1080 or larger
4. The CSS will automatically apply filters to match the UrbanConnect aesthetic

If the image is not found, a CSS-based city pattern will be used as a fallback.
